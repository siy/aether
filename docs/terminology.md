1. Introduction to Slices

In this system, the term Slice is used as a universal abstraction for any discrete, independently deployable and scalable unit. Whether representing a complete service, an end-to-end feature, or an infrastructure component, Slices provide a consistent model for partitioning system functionality. This abstraction allows the system to transparently distribute workloads, scale resources, and isolate failures across both logical and physical boundaries. In contexts where the nature of a Slice requires clarification, specific modifiers are applied.

1. Slice Modifiers

Service Slice:

Definition: A deployable unit encapsulating a distinct service capability, typically aligned with business domains or microservice components.

Use Cases: Microservices, SOA components, API-first architectures.

Example: "The user authentication logic runs as a dedicated Service Slice."

Feature Slice:

Definition: A vertically integrated partition that contains all architectural layers necessary to implement a specific user-facing feature or business capability.

Use Cases: Vertical slicing, modular feature delivery, end-to-end functionality.

Example: "The checkout workflow operates within its own Feature Slice."

Infrastructure Slice (Optional Extension):

Definition: A partition focused on backend resources, such as databases, caches, or messaging systems.

Use Cases: Resource isolation, environment-specific deployments.

Example: "Each tenant is provisioned with an isolated Infrastructure Slice."

Runtime Slice (Optional Extension):

Definition: An ephemeral or dynamically created slice instance supporting elastic scaling or temporary workload execution.

Use Cases: Auto-scaling, batch processing, on-demand workloads.

Example: "During peak hours, additional Runtime Slices handle order processing."
